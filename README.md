# Installation

Install with
    $ pip install [--prefix=<prefix>/--user]
or
    $ pip install -e . [--prefix=<>/--user]
for an editable development build (no need to reinstall package after
modifications).
This has to be done inside the (this) root directory, inside the (virtual) environment, docker container, etc., as applicable.
